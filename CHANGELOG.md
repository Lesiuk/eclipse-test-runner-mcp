# Changelog

## 0.87.0

- **Fix multi-method JUnit view display** — multi-method `run_test` now shows methods under a single class node in Eclipse's JUnit view instead of duplicating the class per method. Uses loader-specific APIs: JUnit 5 multi-selector `LauncherDiscoveryRequest`, JUnit 4 ASM-generated `Filter` subclass.

## 0.86.0

- **Fix method validation with empty method list** — skip validation when `IType.getMethods()` returns empty (e.g. binary types without source), letting Eclipse's test runner handle it instead of failing with an empty "Available methods:" message

## 0.85.0

- **Hint to re-run only failed tests** — `run_test` description now guides LLMs to use `method`/`methods` to re-run only failures, saving significant time for slow test suites (Selenium, SWTBot)

## 0.84.0

- **Multiple test methods in one call** — `run_test` now accepts a `methods` array to run multiple test methods in a single JVM launch, sharing the build step and JVM initialization for efficiency. Works with JUnit 3/4/5/6 and SWTBot. Uses a bundled Java agent that intercepts Eclipse's RemoteTestRunner to execute only the specified methods. Requires Eclipse 2019-06 or newer.

## 0.83.0

- **Debug mode returns test results on termination** — `run_test` in debug mode now collects and returns pass/fail results when the test finishes without hitting a breakpoint
- **Debug wait keepalive** — `run_test` (debug mode) and `step` (resume) send keepalive progress events every 60s while waiting for a breakpoint, preventing client timeouts
- Keepalive interval reduced from 10s to 60s to save tokens

## 0.82.0

- **Streamable HTTP with progress notifications** — long-running tools (`run_test`, `clean_build`, `get_test_results`) now stream progress events via SSE, preventing MCP client timeouts. Individual test pass/fail results are streamed in real-time during test execution.
- Bump MCP protocol version to `2025-03-26`

## v0.81.0

- **Fix NPE in projectNotFoundMessage** — handle null from `getProjects()` when listing available projects in error messages, preventing NullPointerException when workspace has no projects array

## v0.80.0

- **List available projects on "Project not found" errors** — when a tool receives an invalid project name, the error message now includes all open workspace projects so the LLM can self-correct without a separate `list_projects` call

## v0.79.0

- **Show helpful NullPointerException messages** — `evaluate_expression` now invokes `getMessage()` on exceptions in the target VM instead of reading the `detailMessage` field directly, capturing JDK 14+ helpful NPE messages (e.g. "Cannot invoke 'X.method()' because 'Y' is null")

## v0.78.0

- **Add `clean_build` tool** — performs a full clean and rebuild of Eclipse projects from scratch. Use when Eclipse gets heavily out of sync (stale errors, missing classes, broken incremental build state). Accepts an optional `projects` list to target specific projects; omit to clean/rebuild all open projects.

## v0.77.0

- **Fix error dialogs still appearing** — `ProjectBuilder` job now returns `OK_STATUS` instead of error status, preventing Eclipse from showing popup dialogs even when builds fail (errors are still properly returned to MCP caller)

## v0.76.0

- **Suppress error dialogs for MCP-initiated builds** — `ProjectBuilder` job now uses `setSystem(true)` instead of `setUser(true)`, preventing Eclipse from showing error popup windows (e.g. "Project not found") for failures that are already reported back to the MCP caller

## v0.75.0

- **Group compilation errors to reduce LLM token usage** — `run_test` and `get_problems` now deduplicate errors by (project, message), returning grouped entries with count and up to 3 example locations instead of repeating the same error for every affected file. Includes a one-line summary (e.g. "1191 errors (150 unique) in project 'backend'") and caps output at the top 10 groups.

## v0.74.0

- **Preserve console output across test runs** — `checkNoTestRunning()` and `cleanupLaunch()` no longer remove terminated launches from the launch manager, so Eclipse keeps the console output visible instead of clearing it on every `run_test` invocation

## v0.73.0

- **Fix `run_test` stale-launch deadlock** — `checkNoTestRunning()` now removes terminated JUnit launches from the launch manager before checking for running ones, preventing false "already running" errors caused by a race between JUnit session completion and `ILaunch.isTerminated()`
- **Clean up launches after normal test completion** — `launchTest()` now waits for `isTerminated()` and removes the launch from the manager when done, matching the cleanup that `terminate` already performed
- **Reduce `run_test` semaphore timeout from 15 minutes to 30 seconds** — prevents cascading pile-ups when MCP protocol times out and retries queue behind a long-held lock

## v0.72.0

- **Serialize `run_test` calls with a fair semaphore** — only one `run_test` executes at a time; concurrent callers wait up to 15 minutes instead of racing past the launch-in-progress check

## v0.71.0

- **Remove `fields` from variable output** — `VariableCollector` no longer dumps all field names for custom objects, eliminating massive response bloat for classes with many constants

## v0.70.0

- **Extract `VariableCollector` utility** — variable collection/formatting logic extracted from `ListVariablesTool` into a dedicated `VariableCollector` class in the `debugging` package, along with type-classification helpers (`isWellKnownType`, `isCollectionType`, `isMapType`) moved from `EvaluateExpressionTool`

## v0.69.0

- **Auto-include variables when debugger stops** — `step`, `get_debug_state`, and `run_test` (debug mode) now return all visible variables alongside the stop location, eliminating the need for a separate `list_variables` call after every breakpoint hit or step

## v0.68.0

- **`breakpoint action='clear'`** — remove all breakpoints in one call, returns the count of removed breakpoints

## v0.67.0

- **Deduplicate error messages in `evaluate_expression`** — when the same error appears multiple times (e.g. unresolved variable referenced twice), it is now shown only once

## v0.66.0

- **Remove `list_threads` tool** — rarely used; thread info is available via `get_debug_state`
- Tool count reduced from 17 to 16

## v0.65.0

- **Reject duplicate breakpoints** — `breakpoint action='set'` now checks for an existing breakpoint at the same class and line before creating a new one, preventing accidental duplicates

## v0.64.0

- **Source context in debug stop locations** — `step`, `get_debug_state`, and `run_test` (debug mode) now return ~5 lines of source code around the stop point, with the current line marked by `>`, eliminating the need to read the source file after every breakpoint hit or step
- **Merge `step` + `resume` into single `step` tool** — `resume` is now `step` with `action='resume'`; all actions support a `timeout` parameter and return terse reason values (`breakpoint`, `terminated`, `timeout`)
- **Merge `set_breakpoint` + `remove_breakpoint` + `list_breakpoints` into single `breakpoint` tool** — action-based dispatch (`set`, `remove`, `list`) following the same pattern as BPMN2 tools
- **Merge `get_failure_trace` into `get_test_results`** — pass `class` and `method` to get the full unabridged stack trace for a specific failure; no params returns the normal summary
- **Tool count reduced from 21 to 17** — fewer tool definitions means less LLM context overhead per request

## v0.63.0

- **Flat array format** — arrays now shown as `["a", "b", "c"]` instead of indexed objects, matching collection format
- **Better tool descriptions** — `evaluate_expression` now suggests multi-field inspection patterns; `list_variables` description updated for new output format
- Remove unused `ArrayElementInfo` model and `elements` field from results

## v0.62.0

- **Smart collection/map formatting in `evaluate_expression` and `list_variables`** — ArrayList returns `["item1", "item2", ...]` as a flat JSON array; HashMap returns `{"key": "value", ...}` as a JSON object; both include `length` and `truncated` for large collections (preview capped at 10 elements)
- **Auto-invoke `toString()` on custom objects** — shows meaningful representation (e.g. `Order{id=42, total=99.99}`) instead of `Order (id=1234)`
- No internal fields shown for collections, maps, or well-known JDK types

## v0.61.0

- **Skip fields for well-known JDK types** in `evaluate_expression` and `list_variables` — String, Integer, Boolean, BigDecimal, UUID, Date/Time types, etc. no longer show internal fields like `hash`, `coder`, `value`, reducing output noise for the LLM

## v0.60.0

- **Handle `InvalidStackFrameException` gracefully** in `list_variables`, `get_stack_trace`, and `evaluate_expression` — returns actionable guidance ("Use 'get_debug_state' to check current state") instead of raw JDI exception
- **Increase `resume` and `step` timeouts to 5 minutes** (was 30s) — matches `run_test` debug mode timeout, prevents premature timeouts on slow test runs

## v0.59.0

- **`resume` and `step` return test results on termination** — when resuming or stepping causes the debugged test to finish (no more breakpoints, test completes), the response now includes `testResults` with pass/fail counts, elapsed time, and failure details — same data as `run_test` and `get_test_results`, eliminating the need for a separate `get_test_results` call after debug sessions end
- Make `TestResultsHelper` public — reuse test result collection across core and debugging tools

## v0.58.0

- **Extract shared `StackTraceFilter`** — reuse framework-frame filtering between test results and expression evaluation; reads class/method fields directly from JDI `StackTraceElement` for smart filtering (skips JUnit, JDK, Eclipse internals)

## v0.57.0

- **`evaluate_expression` error includes stack trace** — invokes `getStackTrace()` on the target VM exception via JDI to show where the exception was thrown (up to 10 frames)

## v0.56.0

- **Restructure packages to consistent domain-based layout** — move `model/` → `core/model/`, `tools/impl/` → `core/tools/`; all three domains (`core`, `debugging`, `bpmn2`) now follow the same `{domain}/tools/` + `{domain}/model/` pattern; `tools/` retains only the shared framework (McpTool, Args, etc.)

## v0.55.0

- **Use direct JDI imports instead of reflection** for `InvocationException` unwrapping — cleaner code, same behavior

## v0.54.0

- **`evaluate_expression` error now includes exception message** — reads `detailMessage` field from the target VM exception (e.g. `NoSuchElementException: Cannot locate element` instead of just `NoSuchElementException thrown in target VM`)

## v0.53.0

- **`terminate` removes launches from manager after termination** — prevents `run_test` from seeing stale "still running" entries when called immediately after terminate

## v0.52.0

- **Increase `evaluate_expression` timeout to 60s** — both semaphore acquire and evaluation latch

## v0.51.0

- **Increase debug launch timeout to 5 minutes** — 30s was too short for apps that take time to start before hitting a breakpoint

## v0.50.0

- **Fix stale tool descriptions** — `list_variables` and `get_stack_trace` referenced removed `inspect_variable` tool; `run_test` now mentions debug mode waiting behavior

## v0.49.0

- **`run_test` in debug mode waits for first breakpoint** — instead of returning immediately with a "use get_debug_state" message, blocks until a breakpoint is hit or the launch terminates, returning stop reason and location directly

## v0.48.0

- **`step` converted from event listener to polling** — uses `DebugContext.waitForSuspendOrTerminate()` like `resume` and `get_debug_state`, eliminating `IDebugEventSetListener` registration
- **Extract shared poll/location/reason helpers into `DebugContext`** — `waitForSuspendOrTerminate()`, `getCurrentLocation()`, and `getSuspendReason()` eliminate duplication across `resume`, `step`, and `get_debug_state`

## v0.47.0

- **`resume` now blocks until next breakpoint or termination** — polls for suspend/terminate instead of returning immediately, returns stop reason and location (breakpoint, terminated, or timeout)
- **`evaluate_expression` unwraps InvocationException** — error messages now show the actual target-VM exception type (e.g. `NullPointerException thrown in target VM`) instead of the generic JDI wrapper
- **`evaluate_expression` returns JSON values as objects** — when a `java.lang.String` value contains valid JSON, it is returned as a parsed object instead of a double-encoded string

## v0.45.0

- **`evaluate_expression` now queues concurrent calls** — uses a fair semaphore so parallel evaluations wait for the previous one to finish instead of failing with "Cannot perform nested evaluations" (Eclipse JDT limitation)

## v0.44.0

- **Fix startup NPE** — restore separate `StartupHook` class for `IStartup`, since the extension registry creates its own instance where `start()` was never called. Bug introduced in v0.39.0.

## v0.43.0

- Fix startup NPE — workaround with instance delegation (superseded by v0.44.0)

## v0.42.0

- **`terminate` now waits for launches to fully die** — polls up to 10s after requesting termination, preventing race conditions where `run_test` would reject with "test already running" immediately after a successful terminate

## v0.41.0

- **Extract `ProjectBuilder`** — shared refresh & build logic used by `run_test` and `get_problems`, eliminating duplication

## v0.40.0

- **`get_problems` now refreshes and builds before returning** — ensures compilation markers are up-to-date after external file edits, matching the refresh & build pattern used by `run_test`

## v0.39.0

- **Consolidate startup** — delete `StartupHook`, `Activator` now implements `IStartup` directly
- **All tool registration in `ToolRegistry` constructor** — core, debugging, and BPMN2 tools registered in one place
- `DebugContext` self-registers its debug event listener in constructor

## v0.38.0

- **Remove `inspect_variable` tool** — its functionality is now merged into `evaluate_expression`, which already handles variable inspection via expression evaluation
- `evaluate_expression` now returns array element previews (first 10 elements) and truncation flags, matching the old `inspect_variable` output
- Debug tool count reduced from 11 to 10

## v0.37.0

- **Merge all three plugins into a single JAR** — core, debugging, and BPMN2 tools are now shipped together. No more separate `eclipse.mcp.server-debugging` or `eclipse.mcp.server-bpmn2` JARs to install.
- **BPMN2 tools disabled by default** — enable them in `Window > Preferences > MCP Server`. Debugging and core tools remain enabled by default.
- Simplify release workflow — single version tag (`vX.Y.Z`), single JAR artifact
- **Breaking:** existing users should remove the old debugging and BPMN2 JARs from `dropins/` before installing

## bpmn2 v0.4.0

- Compact tool set from 25 to 14 tools to reduce LLM context usage
- Merge add/remove pairs into single tools with `action` parameter: `bpmn2_variable`, `bpmn2_signal`, `bpmn2_import`, `bpmn2_item_definition`, `bpmn2_text_annotation`
- Merge flow tools into `bpmn2_flow` (action: add/update/remove)
- Merge start event, end event, extension point into `bpmn2_node` (action: add/update/remove, type: start_event/end_event/extension_point)
- Drop `add_` prefix from all tool names for consistency
- **Breaking:** all tool names changed — update any scripts or prompts referencing old names

## bpmn2 v0.3.0

- Add `bpmn2_add_text_annotation` — sticky-note diagram comments, optionally attached to nodes/flows
- Add `bpmn2_add_import` — process-level Java class imports for script tasks
- Add `bpmn2_add_item_definition` — standalone type definitions for `evaluatesToTypeRef`
- Add `JavaTypeValidator` — workspace-aware validation that service task interfaces/methods exist via JDT
- Validate `taskName` format and resolve interface/method against Eclipse workspace in `bpmn2_add_service_task` and `bpmn2_update_node`
- `bpmn2_get_process` now returns `imports` and `textAnnotations`

## v0.36.0

- Add MCP Server preference page (`Window > Preferences > MCP Server`) — enable/disable individual tools with per-group Select All / Deselect All buttons
- Tools grouped by module (Core, Debugging, BPMN2) with inline descriptions
- Disabled tools are hidden from `tools/list` and rejected on `tools/call`
- Settings persist across Eclipse restarts

## v0.35.0

- Clarify `get_failure_trace` guidance: run_test stack traces are usually sufficient, only use `get_failure_trace` when full untruncated trace is needed

## bpmn2 v0.2.0

- Replace monolithic `bpmn2_add_node` (14 params) with 7 domain-specific tools: `bpmn2_add_service_task`, `bpmn2_add_subflow_call`, `bpmn2_add_script_task`, `bpmn2_add_extension_point`, `bpmn2_add_gateway`, `bpmn2_add_start_event`, `bpmn2_add_end_event`
- Extract shared node-building code into `Bpmn2NodeHelper` utility
- Add `icon` update support to `bpmn2_update_node`
- Fix `displayName` to use `tns:displayName` attribute instead of metaData
- Improve tool descriptions with workflow hints (e.g. gateway → add_flow with conditions)
- Deduplicate `hasSignalEventDefinition` across AddFlowTool, RemoveNodeTool

## v0.34.0

- Remove redundant fields from responses to save LLM tokens: `testRunName`/`configName` from test results, `expression` from evaluate_expression, `variableCount` from list_variables
- Add workflow hints to `run_test` description: guide LLM to use `get_failure_trace` on failures and retry on compilation errors
- Add `inspect_variable` bracket notation hint to `list_variables` description for truncated arrays
- Improve `terminate` description: explain when to use it (stuck test, 'test already running' error, stopping debug sessions)

## v0.33.0

- Validate `mode` parameter in `run_test` against allowed values

## v0.32.0

- Reduce test session poll interval from 500ms to 100ms and check immediately before sleeping — fast tests no longer wait unnecessarily

## v0.31.0

- Round `elapsedSeconds` in test results to 2 decimal places

## v0.30.0

- Replace `refreshed`/`compiled` booleans in `run_test` response with `refreshedAndBuilt` — a list of project names that were actually refreshed and built, so the LLM knows which subset of the workspace has up-to-date code

## v0.29.0

- Compact `run_test` response — replace verbose `steps` array with `refreshed` and `compiled` boolean flags, remove redundant `success` and `errorCount` fields

## v0.28.0

- Fix: remove global lock from tool execution — `ToolRegistry.callTool()` was `synchronized`, blocking all concurrent tool calls while any single tool was running. When `run_test` blocked waiting for test completion, `get_test_results`, `list_test_runs`, `terminate` etc. would all queue behind the lock and timeout on the client side. The synchronized block now only covers tool lookup and parameter validation; execution runs lock-free.

## v0.27.0

- Add `find_references` tool — find all references to a Java class, method, or field across all open Eclipse workspace projects using Eclipse's semantic search engine
- Results grouped by file with line numbers and source line context
- Validates class and member existence, lists available members on mismatch
- Handles method overloads (searches all overloads together)

## v0.26.0

- Reject `run_test` in debug mode when no breakpoints are set — returns error directing to use `set_breakpoint` first

## Debug v0.6.5

- `get_debug_state` now defaults to `wait_for_suspend=true` — automatically blocks until a breakpoint is hit or the session ends, eliminating the need for LLMs to remember to pass the parameter
- Fix: track debug target from CREATE event — `get_debug_state` was returning `active: false` between launch and first breakpoint hit because `DebugContext` only learned about the target on SUSPEND
- Replace event listener + CountDownLatch wait mechanism with simple polling of `DebugContext` state (fixes `TypeError: fetch failed` caused by blocking on non-Eclipse threads)
- Add `Args.getBoolean(key, defaultValue)` overload for boolean parameters with non-false defaults

## v0.25.0

- Remove `launch_test` tool — `run_test` is now the single tool for running tests, eliminating ambiguity for LLM tool selection
- Remove `launch_test` reference from `run_test` and `list_test_configs` descriptions

## Debug v0.6.2

- `get_debug_state` now supports `wait_for_suspend` parameter — blocks until a breakpoint is hit or the session terminates, replacing inefficient polling loops
- Optional `timeout` parameter (default 30s) controls how long to wait before returning current state

## v0.24.0

- `launch_test` now rejects calls when breakpoints are set — returns error directing to use `run_test` with `mode='debug'` instead
- Reject unknown tool parameters — returns error listing valid parameters (prevents silent misuse like passing `mode` to `launch_test`)

## v0.23.0

- `get_test_results` now returns an error when a debug session is active — prevents deadlock when the test is paused at a breakpoint and can never complete

## v0.22.0

### Debug module (v0.6.1)

- Validate breakpoint locations using Eclipse's `ValidBreakpointLocationLocator` (same infrastructure as Eclipse's "Toggle Breakpoint" action)
- Automatically adjusts breakpoint to nearest valid executable line (returns `adjustedFrom` field when adjusted)
- Rejects lines with no valid breakpoint location with a clear error message
- Skips validation for binary/library classes without source — breakpoints still work
- Fix: use `ITypeRoot.getSource()` instead of `ICompilationUnit` for source retrieval (works for all type resolutions)

## v0.21.0

- Improve `get_failure_trace` tool description to discourage redundant calls — `run_test` and `get_test_results` already return condensed failure messages with exception type, message, and key stack frames

## v0.20.0

- Disable "Skip All Breakpoints" before launching tests in debug mode — ensures breakpoints are always hit

## v0.19.0

- `Args.requireString` now rejects blank strings (catches empty/whitespace-only inputs across all tools)
- `terminate` tool now throws when named config has no matching running launch
- Update `TerminateToolTest` to expect error on unmatched config name

### Debug module (v0.5.0)

- `inspect_variable` validates balanced brackets in path expressions
- `get_debug_state` and `list_threads` now report errors instead of silently ignoring them
- Add `error` field to `DebugStateResult` and `ThreadInfo` models

## v0.18.0

- Validate test method name exists before launching — reports available methods on mismatch

## v0.17.0

- Replace `Map`/`LinkedHashMap` return types with proper Lombok `@Builder` model classes across all tools
- Update `CoverageHelperTest` to use Gson serialization pattern consistent with other tests

### Debug module (v0.4.0)

- `ListVariablesTool` now returns `ListVariablesResult` model class instead of `LinkedHashMap`

## v0.16.0

- Suppress Eclipse focus stealing on breakpoint hit (`PREF_ACTIVATE_WORKBENCH` disabled on startup)
- Validate breakpoint condition syntax before setting (catches syntax errors early via JDT AST parser)
- Deduplicate Maven build config — shared surefire, JUnit, and Mockito config moved to parent pom
- Add `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`

### Debug module (v0.3.0)

- New `list_variables` tool — lists all visible variables with types and values in the current stack frame
- Add breakpoint condition syntax validation in `BreakpointManager`
- Slim down `pom.xml` — inherits shared build config from parent

## v0.15.0

- Restructure into multi-module Maven project (core + debug)
  - `eclipse.mcp.server` — core test runner plugin (all existing tools)
  - `eclipse.mcp.server.debugging` — debug tools add-on (skeleton, requires core)
- Each release now produces two JARs
- ToolRegistry is now extensible — external plugins can register additional tools
- Rename Java packages to `uk.l3si.eclipse.mcp`

## v0.14.0

- Add code coverage support via EclEmma/JaCoCo
  - New `coverage` parameter on `run_test` — launches tests in coverage mode
  - New `get_coverage` tool — returns detailed per-method and per-line coverage for a source class
  - Waits for coverage analysis if still loading (like `get_test_results` waits for running tests)

## v0.13.0

- Initial release
